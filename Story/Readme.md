# How to compile

Run make in console. This should compile main.c and create calc.out. 

main.c shows an example of using Roman_calc library for Roman number calculations.

# How to run

In console type ./calc.out .

When you run the executable, it will ask to enter the first roman number.

If you enter an invalid roman number, it will ask you to enter again.

If the first roman number is valid then, it will ask to enter the second roman number.

If the second roman number is valid then you will be asked to choose operation to perform.

Only + or - operation is supported. If the entered operation is valid then the answer will be shown in the console.
